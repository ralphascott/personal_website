Hi, I'm Ralph Scott.

I'm a political scientist specialising in British politics and quantitative methods. I'm currently a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow in Politics at the [University of Bristol](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/ralph-scott) in the UK.

I have previously held positions at Cardiff University and on the [British Election Study](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/) at the University of Manchester, where I also received my PhD. More detail is in my [CV](CV.qmd).

My fellowship research focuses on the effect of education on political attitudes and behaviour. Specifically, I am looking to both generalise the effect (how does it vary across time and contexts?) and unpick the mechanisms (*how* does education change someone's political outlook?).

I also maintain research interests in political inequality ([how disability affects partisan identity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379424001392); [the impact of voter ID legislation in Britain](https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article/doi/10.1093/pa/gsae039/7917523)) and research methodology ([using LLMs to code open response survey data](https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680241231468)).

You can find my peer-reviewed publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7tmZ35EAAAAJ&hl=en) profile (contact me with any issues accessing these), and replication files for these on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ralphascott).
